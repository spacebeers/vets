                    <p>The practice has been located at three different premises during the last 150 years. Initially founded in Nutley to service the drover’s routes, it was relocated to Greenhedges Avenue in East Grinstead after the Second World War, before moving to its current site on Maypole Road in East Grinstead during 1975. </p>

                    <p>The practice was founded in about 1860 by Mr. Dyer, and is believed to be the oldest veterinary practice in Sussex. Mr Dyer ran the practice until the end of the First world War. Since his retirement, the practice has evolved each time the principal of the day took on a new partner or retired. The practice’s name has change many times during the last 150 years, including from; Glynn & Ashford to Ashford & Strachan, from Ashford & Strachan to Strachan & Hawkridge, and from Strachan & Hawkridge to Hawkridge & Associates. </p>

                    <p>When Mr. Cunnington and Mr. Barrington became partners, it was decided to retain the name Hawkridge & Associates.  The practice remained Hawkridge & Associates until Mr. Hawkridge’s retirement in 2005, when the name was changed to East Grinstead Veterinary Hospital, under Mr. Cunnington and Mr. Barrington.</p>

                    <p>The East Grinstead Veterinary Hospital underlines the practice’s position as the only veterinary practice in East Grinstead with RCVS Accredited Hospital status. We are only Veterinary Practice in the Mid Sussex area with Hospital Accreditation.</p>

                    <p>The RCVS launched the Practice Standards Scheme in March 2006. The pupose of the scheme is to ensure that all veterinary practices adhere to strict guidelines governing quality of medicine practiced, hygiene, clinical governence and service.     </p>

                    <p>Only practices that have succeeded in reaching the highest standards of; medicine & surgery, care & communication and hygiene & cleanliness are allowed to display this symbol.   The East Grinstead Veterinary Hospital is proud to be allowed to display the RCVS Accredited Small Animal Hospital symbol.         </p>

                    <p>The RCVS Practice Standards Scheme is a three-tiered system. For a practice to become accredited as :</p>

                    <p>"RCVS Accredited Core Standards" (or Tier 1), it must fulfil specific criteria regarding; medicine & surgery, care & communication, hygiene & cleanliness and health & safety.</p>

                    <p>"RCVS Accredited General Practice" (or Tier 2), the standards required to be met are more strict.</p>

                    <p>"RCVS Accredited Small Animal Hospital" (or Tier 3) requires yet more strict and wide-ranging standards, including;   Nursing staff present on the premises round the clock and if required a veterinary surgeon available at all times to attend in-patients.  </p>

                    <p>A system for checking that clinical standards are maintained and improved by monitoring performance and outcome of treatments.   A high quality and broad range of available equipment, for example, diagnostic equipment such as ECG and ultrasound.   Premises and facilities that have been rigorously examined, with the emphysis on cleanliness and sterility.</p>
