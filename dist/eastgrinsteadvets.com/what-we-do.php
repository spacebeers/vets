                    <h2>For when your pet is healthy&hellip;</h2>
                    <p>We prefer a pro-active approach to animal health.</p>
                    <p>Prevention is definitely better than cure, not to mention easier, less stressful and much less expensive!</p>
                    <p>We recommend that animals are seen, at least annually for a thorough health check and examination. This can be done in conjunction with the annual vaccination programme. Finding and treating problems promptly can simplify treatment and improve outcome, and the advantage of an annual health check is that it helps us find problems earlier!</p>
                    <p>There has always been much debate about neutering animals (castration for males and spaying for females). The veterinary profession almost unanimously agrees that the routine neutering of animals confers significant health advantages. For example; a significant reduction in the likelihood of developing mammary (breast) cancers and other reproductive cancers (for both sexes), significant reduction in aggressive tendencies (especially males), and removing the possibility of females developing pyometra (a potentially fatal reproductive infection). There are a number of non-health advantages too; neutered animals are less likely to roam or stray, unwanted pregnancies lead to unwanted kittens and puppies (the lucky ones ending up in rescue centres), and living with a calling queen or a bitch on heat can be hell on Earth. We are happy to perform routine neutering surgery from 6 months of age in dogs, and 4 months for cats and rabbits.</p>
                    <p>The team of registered veterinary nurses (VNs) also run a series of nursing clinics. These include; a “weight-watchers” style obesity clinic (for the more generously built pet) involving regular weight checks and dietary advice. Also adolescent, geriatric checks and dental check-ups. If required, the nurses are always happy to administer worm tablets and give preventative healthcare advice.</p>

                    <h2>And for when your pet is sick&hellip;</h2>

                    <p>The vets at the East Grinstead Veterinary Centre aim to practice the very highest standards of medicine and surgery. We undertake a wide variety of clinical procedures to both help us make a diagnosis, and then treat any problems we find.</p>
                    <p>With more than 60 years’ experience between them, the vets have a wide range of particular interests and skills, including, orthopaedic and soft tissue surgery, clinical diagnostic medicine, ultrasonography, endoscopy and clinical laboratory medicine.</p>
                    <p>The centre has a well-equipped in-house laboratory with a high quality blood biochemistry analyser, blood electrolyte machine and haematology machine allowing us to perform a wide variety of blood tests. We also have a Motic® binocular Microscope, which allows us to examine urine, blood cells, discharges, and some lumps and bumps.</p>
                    <p>The centre also prizes its new Imotek® Ultrasound machine which is capable of producing images of outstanding clarity, allowing us to examine internal organs in a non-invasive manner. We were able to see some fantastic images of the beating heart belonging to a dog in congestive heart failure. Examining the images allowed us to choose the best course of treatment for her. </p>
                    <p>In addition, the centre also has superb digital xray facilities and two flexible fibre-optic endoscopes (a big one for dogs and a smaller one for cats). The endoscopes are regularly used to examine (and sometimes take samples from) the inner surface of both the gastro-intestinal tract (throat, stomach and intestines) and the respiratory tract (nose, airway and lungs).</p>
                    <p>Xrays are frequently used as an aid to diagnosis, sometimes even using dyes such as barium meals. They are invaluable in the diagnosis and evaluation of; fractures, arthritis, lung and heart disease, intestinal and bladder problems and some cancers.</p>
                    <p>We are also happy to take hip and elbow xrays as part of the BVA scheme.</p>
                    <p>Problems are normally described as either “medical” or surgical”.</p>
                    <p>Medical problems are treated with medicines, whilst surgical problems are treated with operations. We have a dedicated operating theatre which is only used for sterile surgical procedures.</p>
                    <p>“Sticks and stones may break our [animals’] bones” but here at the East Grinstead Veterinary Centre we have cutting edge orthopaedic instruments which are often used to help pin, plate or screw bones back together.</p>
                    <p>The details on this page are just the tip of the iceberg. We are happy to discuss the ways in which we can help keep our pet healthy, or treat illness.      </p>
